### 🛡 What is Socket?

The open source community is the 💗 heart of Socket and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

- Most of our team members have been publishing open source software for more than a decade
- Open source software created by Socketeers has received a stunning **1 billion** downloads per month 🤯
- Our software is used by individuals and companies around the world 🌍

Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️, we're looking for smart people to join our team 🙌. If you specialize in making computers do things they’re not supposed to do, please drop us a line at work@socket.dev.

### ❤️ Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run Socket, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects like:

- More coming _very_ soon!
