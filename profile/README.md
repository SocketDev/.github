## 👋 Hey, this is Socket

### 🛡 What is Socket?

The open source community is the 💗 heart of Socket and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

- Most of our team members have been publishing open source software for more than a decade
- Open source software created by Socketeers has received a stunning **1 billion** downloads per month 🤯
- Our software is used by individuals and companies around the world 🌍

Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️, we're looking for smart people to join our team 🙌. If you specialize in making computers do things they’re not supposed to do, please drop us a line at work@socket.dev.

### ❤️ Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run Socket, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects like:

- [socket-cli-js](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-cli-js)
- [socket-sdk-js](https://github.com/SocketDev/socket-sdk-js)
- [vscode-socket-security](https://github.com/SocketDev/vscode-socket-security)

We also run [Wormhole](https://wormhole.app) as a free service for the security community. Wormhole lets you share files with end-to-end encryption and a link that automatically expires. So you can keep what you share private and make sure your stuff doesn't stay online forever. Here are a few of the open source projects that power it:

- [wormhole-crypto](https://github.com/SocketDev/wormhole-crypto)
- [fs-access-chunk-store](https://github.com/SocketDev/fs-access-chunk-store)
- [idb-chunk-store](https://github.com/SocketDev/idb-chunk-store)
